FPS Notes

SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace - Public Properties GraphicsDeviceManager. Gets or sets a value that indicates 
whether to sync to the vertical trace (vsync) when presenting the back buffer (MSDN). This thing syncs switching
back buffers with a refresh rate of the monitor. Knowing how technically is updated image on the monitor, it
can be said that the inclusion of this parameter is to prevent cutting the image when changing frames. 

IsFixedTimeStep - Public Properties Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game. Gets or sets a value indicating whether to 
use fixed time steps (MSDN). Parameter responsible for enabling or disabling the regime, which is responsible 
for limiting the frequency of calls to the Update. 

 There are four combinations of these flags: 
1. SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace = false and IsFixedTimeStep = false In this case, the graphics buffers change 
as you draw them, without waiting for the clock, synchronous method is called Update. 
	Features: usually an application does not need to call the Update method with the greatest possible speed. When 
	SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace = false we are able to measure the value exceeding fps refresh rate. Actively use 
	for debugging. 

2. SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace = false and IsFixedTimeStep = true In this case, we can further control the 
frequency of call Update and Draw methods and set a fixed interval through property TargetElapsedTime. 
	Features: dubious pleasure that approach throughout. It is suitable for any exceptional circumstances in 
	which its use is fully justified. Do not use. 

3. SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace = true and IsFixedTimeStep = false It's simple, update, render, waiting for 
synchronization, change back buffers and new. 
	Features: Can not measure fps higher refresh rate of the monitor. Use. 

4. SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace = true IsFixedTimeStep = true and interesting case. If time synchronization 
is less than IsFixedTimeStep, then wait for the next synchronization, and only then performed Update and Draw. 
If the time synchronization more IsFixedTimeStep, then by the fact of the synchronization is performed slowly 
Update and Draw. A kind of lame donkey without one leg.)
